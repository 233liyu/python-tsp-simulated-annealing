Visualisation of Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve Travelling Salesman Problem in Python
=======
Using [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) metaheuristic to solve the [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), and animating the results. 

A simple implementation which provides decent results.

Requires [python3](https://docs.python.org/3/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to work
